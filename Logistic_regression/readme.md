Assignment 4
It’s due on Sunday, by midnight April 7th (only by email). You can submit it individually
or as a team (maximum 3 members).
• You can only use R and/or Stata
• What you submit must be your own work.
• I need ONLY your rmd (R) and/or smcl (Stata) files nothing else. You can use
Stata in one section and R in another section. If you do so, please submit both
smcl and rdm files. Make sure that you don’t print matrix and vector outputs.
• The solutions will be provided later only for R and Stata.
This assignment has 3 parts:
A. House Prices: Dummy-variable models.
B. MC Simulations for biased estimations with model misspecification and measurement errors.
C. Probability models with “utown” data.
Sources: Your ECON 3303 notes and the relevant sections in the textbook. The data,
“utown.dta” for part A and C is on Brightspace.
A. Housing Market estimations
You can use model.matrix() for R or factor operators in Stata (look at your handouts
and the example we had in the class). In this example, we are going to analyze the real
estate market in University Town (UT) and Golden Oak (GO).
1. What’s the average price difference between houses with and without a pool? Is it
significant?
2. Is there any significant difference in the effect of age on house prices between
a. GO and UT,
b. With pool and without pool,
c. With pool and in UT and with pool and in GO
d. Without pool in UT and with pool in GO
3. Are the large houses mostly in UT? Is the size of the house related to the existence a pool?
4. What are the most important factors in house pricing in the market?
